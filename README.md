# **Customer Churn Prediction for OTT Platforms**

## **Project Overview**
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict customer churn for OTT platforms. Using a dataset with customer attributes such as subscription duration, gender, and multi-screen usage, the project builds models to classify customers as churners or retainers. The aim is to provide actionable insights for businesses to improve customer retention strategies.

## **Features of the Code**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and infinite values in the dataset.
   - Standardized features for better model compatibility.

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
